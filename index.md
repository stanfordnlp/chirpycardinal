<h1 class='fs-9'> Welcome to <strong>Chirpy Cardinal</strong>. </h1>
We are a <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/">Stanford NLP</a> research group focussed on open-domain conversational dialogue. <br><br>
Our research is informed by hundreds of thousands of people chatting with our bot Chirpy Cardinal via the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexaprize">Alexa Prize</a>, a university competition to advance conversational AI. <br><br>
In collaboration with <a href="https://oval.cs.stanford.edu">Open Virtual Assistant Lab (OVAL)</a>, we have open-sourced our award-winning socialbot from Alexa Prize 2020/2021.

# Alexa Prize 4 (2020-2021)

In July 2021, our much improved Chirpy Cardinal again won 2nd place in the finals of the Alexa Prize Socialbot Grand Challenge 4.

The Chirpy Cardinal team worked hard building on the success of the first team. Updates included:

- Working on methods for controllable neural generation
- Updating the previous news, music and movies modules with new APIs, as well as major improvements in entity linking, topical transitions, and latency
- Expanding the variety of responses via new modules that focus on personal issues, sports, food, and even extraterrestrial life!
