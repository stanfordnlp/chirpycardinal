<p>This is a live demo of the <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Vr_BTpw3wz">Hindsight System</a>. It is able to retrieve passages from all of Wikipedia and use them in the conversation. You can click on the Passage button to see the passage used for generating an utterance. While the utterances are more grounded than other systems, they are not perfect. If you find interesting failure modes, reach out to me at ashwinp@cs.stanford.edu; I'm always curious and interested. It uses wikipedia dump from 2018, so can't talk about the latest topics yet (including COVID-19). Here are some suggestions: Finding Nemo, iPhone, Hemingway, your hometown :)  </p>
